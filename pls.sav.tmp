relevant optical materials physics, followed by a discussion of the available tools for computing
optical properties of materials (Section 3). Rather than being exhaustive, we review unique cases
in which first-principles calculations have been used to understand and predict linear optical
properties (Section 4) and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties (Section 5) of inorganic materials.
Finally, we conclude by summarizing future issues for materials researchers.

•The real part of the refractive index n gives
rise to refraction and reflectivity, whereas the imaginary part κ is responsible for optical absorption
and attenuation

•All terms can be expanded in a power series. At first
order, one recovers the dielectric susceptibility of a linear medium, whereas terms of increasing
order become more important in nonlinear materials

•Calculations on first-principles determination of band structures for MgO, ZnO and CdO oxides (pg. 8)

•"...and thus tuning of the
order parameter can be exploited to adjust the band gap for solar-cell applications (ref. 68)"

•Nanostructures have dimensions on nanometer scale and are qualitativly different from bulk materials

•2D, 1D and 0D structures discussed

•The band gap of bulk MoS2 is indirect, but it becomes direct if the spatial dimensions are reduced to one MoS2 monolayer

• First-principles calculations
have demonstrated that only the MoS2 monolayer exhibits a direct band gap, whereas thicker
MoS2 samples have indirect band gaps

•Quantum confinement in 1D: calculations have demonstrated that the electronic band gap of smalldiameter Si nanowires increases by several electron volts and that the optical absorption spectrum
is characterized by strong excitonic effects 

•Partial axial strain can seperate photo-generated electrons and holes in small-diameter Si wires

•Calculations also for 0D quantum dots

•However, thermal motion generates atomic vibrations, which need to be accounted for in describing optical properties at finite 

•The interaction of the electrons with the atomic vibrations
gives rise to the temperature dependence of the band structure and enables optical transitions that
would otherwise be forbidden by symmetry.

•the zero-point motion corrections to the direct band gap of diamond are as large as 0.6 eV

•Atomic vibrations allow for the breaking of symmetry in bulk-Si allowing for photon absorption

occupancy of octahedrally-coordinated site M, with Mn3+ hosted at M, while Mn2+ and Fe3+ are distributed
over both sites

•Three different pathways can give rise to excellent black
pigments: 
a) strongly disordered spinels having an inversion parameter i ∼ 0.2; 
b) moderately disordered
spinels, free of Mn3+, with i < 0.1
c) apparently ordered and normal spinels halfway from cobalt chromite
and cobalt ferrite

• A completely random distribution between T and M sites occurs when i = 2/3; therefore, a spinel with
0 < i < 2/3 is "largely normal" while another one with 2/3 < i < 1 is "largely inverse" [8-9]

•The best
technological behaviour in ceramic glazes is that of Co1-xMnxCr2-yFeyO4 compositions where 0.4<x<1.0 and
0.14<y<0.72 with some nickel occasionally present [33-36]

•The main goal of the present study is to disclose the best composition in the Co-Cr-Fe-Mn system by
reappraising crystal structure, optical properties and ceramic behaviour of black spinels. Such an approach
is expected to shed light on pigment-glaze interactions affecting the final crystallo-chemical features after
the ceramic process.

•The cations
expected to occur in the system under investigation present an affinity for the sixfold-coordinated site in
decreasing order: Cr3+ > Mn3+ ~ Ni3+ ~ Co3+ > Co2+ ~ Fe2+

•In order to get the purest black colour, minimal values of L* and C* (a*^2+b*^2)^0.5 are the
target

•All the analyzed powders are exclusively composed of one phase with spinel structure-type, with the only
exception of samples 1, 3, and 10, where an eskolaite–hematite solid solution was detected (ranging from
7 to 18%, see Table 3). 

•1, 3 and 10 compositions estimates from literature search not from analysis

•Such spectra are somewhat interpreted as due
to relaxation phenomena, i.e., a magnetic behaviour which is manifested by nanosized iron oxide species
(i.e. clusters or nanoparticles ≤ 10 nm), but this explanation cannot apply to the present case because the
spinel samples here investigated have crystallite size estimated between 85 and 151 nm

• An
alternative explanation is that the Fe is increasingly incorporated but not homogeneously distributed into
the spinel structure, this leading to a number of local arrangements richer in Fe and diluted in a spinel
matrix poorer in Fe

•The
additional raman peaks are due to the interaction of coexisting cations in the T and M sites, each of them with an
effect on the Raman spectrum, in solid solutions or in the presence of cation site inversion

• Another effect of cation disorder is peak
broadening [58, 59], which also occurs when small sized particles are present

•The position of the 660 cm-1 peak was related to the reciprocal of the
mass square root of the cation in the octahedral site 

•Manganese is present either as Mn2+ partitioning over T and M sites, or Mn3+
occupying only the M site by 0.12-1.0 atoms per formula unit (apfu), or both

•Iron is present essentially as Fe3+, as indicated by the Mössbauer spectroscopy, being preferentially
hosted at the octahedrally-coordinated site

•. Unexpectedly, two samples (20 and 21) do not match this crystal chemical
pattern: as in these spinels the octahedrally-coordinated M site is saturated by trivalent chromium and
iron ions, only divalent ions should be accommodated at the tetrahedrally-coordinated T site

•Firing under reducing conditions can reduce but not remove the eskolaite-hematite secondary phase of  samples 20 and 21

•Partitioning of Fe and Mn over the two sites of spinel is stressed when the nominal sum Cr+Fe+Mn exceeds
2 apfu. remarkable degree of disorder found in the 10 samples that fit this condition

•As-synthesized pigments exhibit a deep black colour with very low
brightness, 38.6 < L*as < 40.5, and chroma, 0.2 < C*as < 1.2

•the best
behaviour is on average that of samples 12, 11 and 6 which display colour coordinates (28 < L*av < 30
and C*av ≤ 0.6) matching those of the best industrially-manufactures spinels, including Ni-bearing
formulations

•Contour plots were drawn in order to disclose the best
pigment compositions by contrasting average chroma (C*av) with crystal chemistry of spinels

•The best high temperature (>1200°C) behaviour relates to a small field excluding both low and high Co2+ and Cr3+ in T and M sites respectively

•Overall, the best behaviour corresponds to a crystal chemistry where
the tetrahedrally-coordinated site is mainly occupied by Co2+ (0.4-0.8 apfu) together with Mn2+ (0.1-0.5)
and Fe3+ (0.1-0.25), and the octahedrally-coordinated site is predominantly occupied by Cr3+ (0.9-1.5 apfu)
together with Fe3+ (0.3-1.0), Mn3+ (0.1-0.5) and Mn2+ (≤0.21).

•Three different pathways are envisaged to get deep black shades:
a) strongly disordered spinels, characterized by very broad and hardly resolvable Raman peaks and
occurrence of magnetic sextets in Mössbauer spectra, hosting at least 7 transition metal cations and
having an inversion parameter i ∼ 0.2 (e.g., sample 12);
b) moderately disordered spinels, exhibiting several Raman peaks beyond the Group Theory prediction but
a typical paramagnetic Mössbauer spectrum, being free of Mn3+ and having an inversion parameter i <
0.1 (e.g., sample 11);
c) apparently ordered and normal spinels halfway from cobalt chromite and cobalt ferrite showing clues of
disorder by extra peaks in well resolved Raman spectra and predominance of magnetic absorption in
Mössbauer spectra (e.g., sample 6).

•It occurred in spinels exhibiting a high amount of Mn3+: 0.64 apfu in the
sample 13 or 1.0 apfu for samples 5 and 8 (Table 1). However, the occurrence of trivalent manganese is not
detrimental by itself: for example in the sample 12, displaying the best technological behaviour, VIMn3+ is
as high as 0.33 apfu

•Mn reaction evolves gases and lowers the melt viscocity 

•In fact, trivalent manganese in spinel could be unstable in contact with
glaze during ceramic firing; its reduction may lead to oxygen evolution: 2 MMn3+ + 2 e- → 2 MMn2+ + VO,
implying the formation of oxygen vacancies

•Increasing the amount of spinel dissolved in the glaze causes a lowering of glaze
viscosity 

•In contrast, the glazes containing samples 6, 11 and 12
have their viscosity lowered by no more than 1%, so not enough to cause bloating

• An important aspect, disclosed here for the first time in
ceramic pigments, is that the spinel lattice parameter turns systematically smaller after the ceramic
processing (Table 6).

•It implies that the concept
of resistance to corrosion of spinel involves the ability to adjust its composition without losing colouring
strength

•Although Al, An and Mg are associated with glazes the only cation with a small radius that is abundant in glazes and at the
same time can be readily accommodated in both sites of the spinel lattice is the Al3+ 

•the smaller unit cell
parameter of spinels after ceramic firing (aaf) could be justified by an Al3+ substitution after, e.g., Mn3+
and/or Fe3+ at the octahedral site

•The
following ranges are recommended to get the best black pigments: Co2+ (0.4-0.8 apfu) together with Mn2+
(0.1-0.5) and Fe3+ (0.1-0.25) at T site; Cr3+ (0.9-1.5 apfu) together with Fe3+ (0.3-1.0), Mn3+ (0.1-0.5) and
Mn2+ (≤0.21) at M site.},

calculations within the generalized gradient approximation of the density functional theory. It is interesting to note that a linear
increase of cell volume (V) with increasing doping amount (x) occurs. The band gap increases in the series from 3.851 eV to
5.079 eV, which is in agreement with theoretical and experimental values. In addition, a blue shift of the absorption shoulder is
observed in the UV region with the increase of x, as predicted by the imaginary part 2() of the dielectric function at zero
frequency as well as bandgap. This can be explained by the threshold of the electronic transition from O-2p to the empty Mg-3p
electron states due to the substitution of Zn with Mg. The real part 1() of the dielectric function located at zero frequency has
a square fit relationship with refractive index n(0), which is 1.71–1.77 from x=0 to x=1. The energy-loss function shows that the
replacement of Zn by Mg is responsible for a decrease in the intensity of the sharp peaks. The reflectivity shows that a higher
coefficient of reflectivity (R(0)) at zero frequency corresponds to a smaller bandgap.},

  abstract  = {In this study, production and characterisation of pigments by using less expensive raw materials such as limonite and chromite
was undertaken. The resulting pigments were characterised by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The
colour of glazed tiles containing 3 wt.% pigment change from dark brown to light brown depending on the calcination temperature
and limonite content. With pigments prepared with 50% limonite content calcined at 1250 C, the chocolate brown colour was
obtained corresponding to the commercial brown pigments. An iron-chromium black pigment was synthesised from a mixture of
pure chromium (III) oxide (Cr2O3) and iron (III) oxide (Fe2O3) powders and was used to determine possible interactions between a
pigment and a transparent glaze. The interactions were studied using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) attached with an
energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). The results showed that black pigment particles give brown colour to the glaze. EDX
analysis on pigment crystals embedded in the glaze clearly showed that Zn and Mg diffused into pigment crystals and caused a
change of colour from black to brown.},

which yield results that do not only look real, but are also radiometrically correct renditions of
nature, i.e., which are accurate predictions of what a real scene would look like under given lighting
conditions. A real coating consists of pigments, effect pigments, clear lacquer and glaze. A novel
and unique combination of real parameters that are commonly measured in the industry and a
theoretical reflectance model consisting of measurable parameters is required. Here, the authors
design perception parameters and put them into well known surface reflection functions such as He
and Torrance. The original contributions are the study of the sub-surface scattering of real paint
and the prediction of its appearance in rendered images by the proposed model of light reflection
beneath the paint surface.},

•""Industry needs to
solve the inverse problem — i.e., based on the materials in surface paints, deduce the
appearance.

•The quantification of appearance by the paint and coatings industries has resulted
in a set of appearance measurement standards: tristimulus colorimetry, gloss and haze.

•Tristimulus colorimetry is essentially a measure of diffuse reflection color

•Gloss is a measure of the magnitude of the specular reflection, and haze, also called glitter,
captures the width of the specular lobe.

•Gloss is defined by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) to be “the
angular selectivity of reflectance, involving surface-reflected light, responsible for the degree to which reflected highlights or images of objects may be seen as superimposed on
a surface”

thin layers of metal oxide which both reflect and transmit incident light."},

the properties that can be obtained with widely available programs as well as how to account for the
environmental effects (solvent and surfaces) and present recent applications in these fields. We next
expose the transformation of the TD-DFT results into chemically intuitive parameters (colours as well as
charge-transfer distances). Eventually, the non-specialised reader will find a series of advices and
warnings necessary to perform her/his first TD-DFT calculations.},

model was originally viewed as unable to describe chemical

•DFT should be extended to account for the
time-dependent (TD) nature of the electromagnetic waves

•Vertical absorption is, by far, the most commonly computed data in TD-DFT, as it
does not require the knowledge of the EES density nor energy
gradient.

•The adiabatic contribution is simply the difference of energies
of the two states in their respective minimum, that is

•The advantage of
computing the 0–0 energies is that well grounded comparisons
with experiments can be made.
